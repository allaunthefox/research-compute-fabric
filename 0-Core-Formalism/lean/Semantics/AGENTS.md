# AGENTS.md - Lean/Semantics

Scope: `0-Core-Formalism/lean/Semantics/`

The strict operating rules live in `../../../6-Documentation/docs/AGENTS.md`.
Follow those rules for all Lean, proof, fixed-point, hardware-extraction, and
shim-boundary work.

## Local Rules

- Keep module names aligned with file names and namespaces.
- Prefer small domain modules over utility files.
- Every new computational gate needs an executable witness: theorem, `#eval`,
  or native-decision proof.
- Run the narrow build target first, for example:

```bash
lake build Semantics.BeaverMaskFreshness
```

- Run the broader build before claiming a stable Lean surface:

```bash
lake build
```

- Do not delete difficult theorems to make builds pass. Fix proofs or quarantine
  with an explicit `TODO(lean-port): ...` boundary.
- Treat generated Python, Rust, Verilog, and JSON as shims or receipts, not as
  the formal source of truth.
- Float (`Q16_16.ofFloat`, `Q0_16.ofFloat`, `Q0_64.ofFloat`) is forbidden in
  compute-path code. Use `Q16_16.ofNat`, `Q16_16.ofRatio`, or `Q16_16.ofInt`
  instead. The historical 5 contamination sites in `BraidCross.lean:49,50,84`
  and `BraidStrand.lean:57,71` are the canonical fixed-point constructor
  template.
- Every new compressor theorem pair MUST provide both `eigensolid_convergence`
  and `receipt_invertible`. The convergence theorem proves the crossing loop
  stabilizes; the invertibility theorem proves the receipt bijectively encodes
  the original state including zero/gap/timing/absence dimensions.
- The BraidEigensolid module (`Semantics.BraidEigensolid`) is the canonical
  compressor target (planned, not yet written): 10 sections covering Q0_2
  crossing matrix, Sidon labels (powers of 2), golden centering (φ⁻¹ = 0x9E70),
  eigensolid convergence, receipt invertibility, and Anti-BraidStorm adversarial
  check. The fixed-point constructor patterns in `BraidCross` and `BraidStrand`
  must compile first.
- Receipt invertibility is a stronger theorem than convergence. Convergence says
  `crossStep(crossStep(s)) = crossStep(s)`. Invertibility says the full receipt
  `(C, sidon, k, ε_seq, t, ∅_scars)` bijectively reconstructs `s` and that
  `decode(encode(s)) = s` holds for all valid inputs.
- enwik9 is the end-to-end test vector. The hierarchical compressor
  (bytes→chunks→banks→file) must prove `decode(encode(enwik9)) = enwik9` byte-
  for-byte via a Lean execution witness.

## Current Stack-Solidification Anchors

- `Semantics.BeaverMaskFreshness` is a finite admission gate for Beaver-mask
  freshness negative controls.
- `Semantics.HCMMR.Kernels.EntropyCollapseDetector` is the finite arithmetic
  receipt for the corrected entropy-collapse detector. It intentionally keeps
  logarithmic/Hurst quantities as scaled receipt constants and proves the
  dense-rank crossing count, D2 numerator, and Kendall tail values with
  executable Lean checks.
- Stack status receipts live under `shared-data/data/stack_solidification/`.
- The canonical arithmetic note is
  `../../../6-Documentation/docs/distilled/ArithmeticSpec_Corrected_2026-05-11.md`.
  Treat `sigma_q` on `n=8` as a deterministic window feature, not as a robust
  Hurst estimator.
- The K=21 prime-gap rerun receipt is
  `../../../shared-data/data/stack_solidification/prime_gap_k21_rerun_receipt_2026-05-11.md`.
  Its conclusion is deliberately bounded: rare surviving windows are candidate
  motifs, not a general prime-gap collapse theorem.
- Historical staged slices are documented in
  `../../../6-Documentation/docs/stack_solidification_staging_manifest_2026-05-09.md`
  and
  `../../../6-Documentation/docs/stack_solidification_staging_manifest_2026-05-10.md`.

## Local Quarantine Boundaries

- The root `.gitignore` excludes known local formal scratch/WIP such as
  `2-Search-Space/FAMM/FAMM_FSDU.lean` and `4-Infrastructure/hardware/test.lean`.
  Do not revive ignored Lean files into the clean build surface without first
  making them compile under a narrow target.
- Generated `*_tb.v` and `*_test_vectors.json` files are build artifacts unless
  a task explicitly promotes one as a hardware receipt.

## Blessed Compiler Surface (as of 2026-05-26, commit `8d158bf9`)

The `Compiler` lean_lib in `lakefile.toml` gates the promoted API surface.
Only the following roots are blessed for downstream import and receipt emission:

| Root | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Semantics.RRC.Emit` | Alignment classifier; `emitCorpus` generic entry point |
| `Semantics.AVMIsa.Emit` | **Sole output boundary** — AVM canaries + stamps all receipts |
| `Semantics.RRC.Corpus278` | 278-equation raw feature list (Python-supplied, Lean-gated) |

Build the narrow surface with:

```bash
lake build Compiler
```

Build the full workspace with:

```bash
lake build
```

Compiler surface baseline: **3313 jobs, 0 errors** (`lake build Compiler`, commit `1931cb30`, reverified 2026-05-27).
Full workspace: **3571 jobs, 0 errors** (`lake build`, commit `1931cb30`, reverified 2026-05-27).
PistSimulation: **3309 jobs, 0 errors** (`lake build Semantics.PistSimulation`, commit `778b78d3`, reverified 2026-05-27).

### goldenContractionEnergyDecrease — proof status

**Statement:** For Burgers fields with non-negative `u` and pointwise contraction `u'[i] ≤ u[i]`, the golden-contraction dissipation step reduces kinetic energy.

**Status:** Formal proof complete. The proof lifts pointwise square inequalities
through a `List.Forall₂` fold induction and uses `Array.foldl_toList` only to
connect the array energy definition to the list proof.

**Current theorem hypotheses:** `h_u_nonneg`, `h_u'_nonneg`, `h_pt`
(pointwise `u'[i] ≤ u[i]`), `h_size`, `hN`. Convexity is not part of this
theorem; it belongs in a separate premise-discharge lemma for `h_pt` and
`h_u'_nonneg`.

### Architecture: AVM is the sole output boundary

```
RRC.Corpus278   — 278 FixtureRows, raw features only (no decisions)
      ↓ emitCorpus
RRC.Emit        — alignment gate (missingPrediction / alignedExact / etc.)
      ↓ emitRrcCorpus278
AVMIsa.Emit     — AVM canaries must pass; stamps avm.rrc_corpus278.bundle
                  emits final JSON; SOLE output boundary
```

**Rule:** Nothing outside `AVMIsa.Emit` may emit a top-level receipt JSON.
`RRC.Emit` is a classifier that feeds it. `RRC.Corpus278` supplies raw features.

### Goal A canary receipt (AVMIsa.Emit §1–6)

Three passing canaries: `avm.canary.not`, `avm.canary.and`, `avm.canary.or`.
Expected `#eval emit.json` shape:

```json
{
  "schema": "avm_canary_emit_v1",
  "all_canaries_passed": true,
  "receipts": [...],
  "rrc_logogram": { "shape": "logogramProjection", ... },
  "projection_passed": true
}
```

### 278-equation corpus (AVMIsa.Emit §7 / RRC.Corpus278)

`emitRrcCorpus278` classifies all 278 rows and stamps the bundle.
Expected `#eval` corpus summary: `(278, <passed>, 278 - <passed>)`.

Current state: `(278, 0, 278)` — all held, no PIST labels present yet.
This is **correct and honest** — the gate reports exactly what it sees.

The PIST predictions merge pipeline:
  `pist_matrix_builder.py` → `rrc_pist_predictions_278_v1.json` → `build_corpus278.py` reads it
  and populates `pistProxyLabel`/`pistExactLabel` in generated `Corpus278.lean`.
  The merge is keyed by `invariant_receipt.object_id` (equation_id = `rrc_eq_<hex>`).
  When the predictions artifact has non-null labels, regenerating Corpus278.lean
  via `python3 4-Infrastructure/shim/build_corpus278.py` will automatically flow them
  into `determineAlignment` — no Lean emit logic changes needed.

Each row carries 5 generator fields for EN9wiki page generation:
- `operatorTokens` — domain/operator token list (from route_hint + rrc_kind)
- `invariantsDeclared` — declared invariant family (from domain_type)
- `boundaryConds` — binding class (from bind_class)
- `templateKey` — page-generator template (`definition`/`master_equation`/`gate`/`receipt`/`hold`)
- `templateParams` — compact rendering parameter string

To regenerate `Corpus278.lean` from source:

```bash
python3 4-Infrastructure/shim/build_corpus278.py
```

Python's role: raw feature extraction only. Lean's role: all gating decisions.

## Quarantined Modules (not in build surface)

| Module | File | Reason |
|--------|------|--------|
| `PIST.HybridTSMPISTTorus` | `2-Search-Space/PIST/HybridTSMPISTTorus.lean` | 2 sorry-related errors; no importers |

Quarantined files are excluded from `lakefile.toml` PIST roots. Revive only
after narrowly compiling the file under a scratch target.

## Pending Proof Work

- `goldenContractionEnergyDecrease` is discharged. Remaining follow-up is a
  separate premise-discharge lemma showing when the Burgers golden-contraction
  step satisfies `h_pt` and `h_u'_nonneg`.
- `HyperbolicStateSurface.ko_preserves_hyperbola_approx`: former sorry replaced
  by explicit premise `onHyperbolaApprox (forwardStep s Δu) Q16_16.epsilon` (line 69).
  Remaining: `TODO(lean-port)` discharge that premise from a formal `Q16_16.sqrt`
  error-bound lemma.
- `SSMS.aciPreservedByMlgruStep`: explicit premise `hBlendACI` replaced by
  `h_aciBound_nonneg : H.aciBound.toInt ≥ 0` (line 549). The `f_eps` and
  `omf_eps` sub-lemmas are proved with `omega` (lines 627–641). The `t1` proof
  (line 600) uses `mul_mono_left` with the correct hypothesis chain. The `t2`
  proof (line 617) corrected to pass `Q16_16.abs (cT i - cT j)` as the first
  arg to `mul_mono_left`. Critical remaining blocker: `Q16_16.abs_triangle` is
  admitted (FixedPoint.lean:674); the `bound` calc uses it and is effectively
  admitted. Once `abs_triangle` is proved, `aciPreservedByMlgruStep` closes.
- `FixedPoint.lean` Q16_16 lemma library (lines 617–695):
  - `mul_mono_left/right` ✅ PROVED — `Int.ediv_le_ediv hpos hmul` pattern works
    with explicit `hpos : 0 < q16Scale` proof
  - `sub_eq_add_neg` (line 620): admit, unused
  - `add_le_add` (line 652): admit, unused
  - `abs_nonneg` (line 659): admit, unused
  - `abs_mul_le` (line 665): admit, unused
  - `abs_triangle` (line 674): admit, used in SSMS `bound` — the `q16Clamp`
    internal `Int.abs` makes sign analysis non-trivial; needs case split on sign
    of `(a.toInt * b.toInt) / q16Scale`

## Key API Notes (Lean 4.30 / this workspace)

- `Q16_16` is a Subtype `{ x : Int // q16MinRaw ≤ x ∧ x ≤ q16MaxRaw }`.
  Safe constructors: `Q16_16.ofRawInt (n : Int)`, `Q16_16.ofBits (u : UInt32)`,
  `Q16_16.ofNat`, `Q16_16.ofRatio`. No struct literals `{ val := N }`.
- `Q0_16` has `add`/`sub` (no `addSat`/`subSat`).
- `List.get?` does not exist — use `list[i]?` subscript syntax.
- `liftMetaM` is the correct combinator for `MetaM → TacticM` in `mapM`.
- `MVarId.toNat` does not exist — use `g.name.toString`.
- `List.size` → `.length`; `Json.num Nat` → `Json.num { mantissa := (n : Int), exponent := 0 }`.
