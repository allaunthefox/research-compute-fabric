# ARCHITECTURE.md — Observerless Research Stack

**The single-page map of the system. Read this first.**

---

## 1. Core Idea

The Observerless Research Stack is a formal verification and compression system grounded in cross-domain invariant analysis. Every transformation — whether a byte-compression pass, a PDE discretization step, or a spiking-neuron firing — is treated as a receipt-bearing event that must preserve declared invariants. Lean 4 is the source of truth. All computation uses Q16.16 fixed-point arithmetic. No floating-point, no unproven claims, no receipt-free promotions.

### 2.1 External Frontier Import: OpenAI Unit-Distance 2026

The 2026 OpenAI planar unit-distance result is now tracked as an external reference in `6-Documentation/docs/research/OPENAI_UNIT_DISTANCE_2026_IMPORT.md`.

Layer placement:

| Level | Import Hook |
|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Norm-one algebraic elements as arithmetic witnesses for unit translations |
| 1 | High-dimensional lattice cuts projecting to planar unit-distance graphs |
| 2 | Structural analogy only: latent code projecting to dense interaction graph |
| 3 | Search-cost/compression lesson for reusable construction families |
| 4 | FAMM/AngrySphinx prior update: preserve lawful long-shot cross-domain routes |
| 5 | Semantic bridge: algebraic number theory to discrete geometry |
| 6 | Meta-search policy: broad machinery + persistence + verifier feedback |

## 3. Three-Axis Pipeline

```
Substrate (ENE) ←→ Surface (Notion) ←→ Intent (Linear)
         │              │              │
         └──────────────┼──────────────┘
                        ▼
                   Metatype
                 (Q0_64 scalar)
```

- **ENE (Substrate)**: Holds ground truth — the SQLite-backed package store with hyperbolic concept coordinates
- **Notion (Surface)**: Human-facing UI and research database
- **Linear (Intent)**: Issue tracking and work orchestration
- **Metatype**: The 1D Q0_64 scalar interface that every substrate reduces to, enabling cross-tier communication

## 5. Seven Core Invariants

| # | Invariant | Source | Domain | Statement |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Mass Conservation | PIST | Geometry | mass = t·(2k+1−t) is preserved under all lawful transitions |
| 2 | Exponential Gate | AngrySphinx | Security | E_solve ≥ 2^n where n = type depth; NaN boundary at F=0 |
| 3 | Semantic Prime Conservation | CrossDimensionalFilter | Semantics | 12 irreducible primes preserved across dimensional reduction |
| 4 | Frustration Monotonicity | FAMM | Security | Triadic incompatibility → frustration grows until resolved |
| 5 | Homeostatic Fixed Point | HomeostaticGovernor | Thermodynamics | Compression pressure converges to stable p* |
| 6 | Cognitive Load Decomposition | CognitiveLoad | Meta | Strategy selection minimizes total load across 5 components |
| 7 | Q0_64 Scalar Universality | GENSIS | Meta | Every substrate state reduces to a single unsigned [0,1) scalar |

---

## 6. Framework Hierarchy

```
GCCL = Law Stack (what must be preserved)
  │
  ├── MISC = Compression Engine (how it runs)
  │     Uses: PIST shells, GWL coupling, Cognitive Router, Trixal Verify
  │     │
  │     └── GENSIS = N-D Extension (genetic codes + hypercubic shells)
  │           Adds: 64 codon tables, Izhikevich neurons, STDP, XNA backbones
  │
  └── USTSM = Substrate Census (36 substrates under one Q0_64 scalar)
        Maps: every substrate → state/metric/transition/invariant/guard/scalar
```

## 7. Repository Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `0-Core-Formalism/lean/Semantics/` | Lean 4 source (truth), FixedPoint, PIST, GWL, AVMR, FAMM, RRC.Emit, AVMIsa.Emit, RRC.Corpus278 |
| `0-Core-Formalism/otom/` | One-Truth-Only-Model consolidated spec |
| `0-Core-Formalism/core/` | Rust/Python extraction targets |
| `1-Distributed-Systems/` | ENE mesh nodes, gossip, waveprobe |
| `2-Search-Space/manifold/` | Manifold compression algos (pist_gcl_compression.py, shifters/) |
| `3-Mathematical-Models/` | Equation registry, math databases, model maps |
| `4-Infrastructure/` | Shims, GPU, FPGA Verilog, drivers |
| `5-Applications/` | Scripts, tests, Hutter prize work, audit tools |
| `6-Documentation/docs/` | Main documentation tree |
| `docs/` | Research papers, specs, roadmaps (aliased into 6-Documentation) |
| `4-Infrastructure/infra/ene-rds/` | ENE RDS Rust workspace (8 crates, replaces Python RDS stack; Axum API on :3000) |
| `4-Infrastructure/storage/` | restic + Garage S3 + rclone storage stack; `storage_agent.py` observer |
| `.devcontainer/` | NixOS devcontainer flake (OpenGL/X11, Lean, Python science stack, MCP: Notion + AWS) |
| `shared-data/` | Databases, golden traces, artifacts |
| `workspace-config/` | IDE and environment settings |
| `scratch/` | Experimental code |

### 7.1 Compiler Surface (Blessed Output Boundary)

The `Compiler` lean_lib (`lakefile.toml`) is the sole gate for downstream
import and receipt emission. Only three roots are blessed:

| Root | Role |
|------|------|
| `Semantics.RRC.Corpus278` | 278 raw FixtureRows — Python-supplied, Lean-gated; no decisions |
| `Semantics.RRC.Emit` | Alignment classifier (`missingPrediction` / `alignedExact` / etc.) |
| `Semantics.AVMIsa.Emit` | **Sole output boundary** — AVM canaries must pass; stamps and emits all receipt JSON |

**Invariant:** nothing outside `AVMIsa.Emit` may emit a top-level receipt JSON.
The pipeline is:

```
RRC.Corpus278  →(emitCorpus)→  RRC.Emit  →(emitRrcCorpus278)→  AVMIsa.Emit  →  JSON receipt
```

Build the narrow surface: `lake build Compiler` (3311 jobs, 0 errors, commit `8d158bf9`).

## 8. Settlements & Promotion Ladder

**Settlement states** (every artifact lives in one):

```
SEED → FORMING → STABLE → CRYSTALLIZED → COMPRESSED
```

Progression requires receipt-bearing evidence at each transition.

**Promotion ladder** (for models, not artifacts):

```
RAW_IDEA
  → SANITIZED_METAPHOR
  → TOY_MODEL
  → TYPED_MODEL
  → RESIDUAL_TESTED
  → COST_ACCOUNTED
  → PROOF_CANDIDATE
  → CORE_MODULE
```

Demotion is equally important — a broken proof goes back to COST_ACCOUNTED. A misleading analogy goes to METAPHOR_ONLY / ARCHIVED.

---

## 9. The Bounded Lawful Surface

Raw GCCL may be extremely expressive. Lawful GCCL is receipt-bounded.

A transition enters the lawful surface only if it satisfies:

```
valid syntax
+ declared projection
+ round-trip or explicit loss policy
+ invariant preservation
+ residual bound
+ KOT/cost bound
+ receipt
+ scale validity
```

**No receipt, no promotion. No residual, no lawfulness claim.**

## 11. Storage & Persistence Layer

Three tools with non-overlapping responsibilities:

| Tool | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **restic** | Deduplicated, encrypted, content-addressed snapshots | Primary backend: Garage S3 |
| **Garage v2.3.0** | Self-hosted S3-compatible object store over Tailscale mesh | 5 buckets; `replication_factor=1` (scale-out to 3 planned) |
| **rclone** | Raw sync between remotes (Garage↔gdrive) | Cold copy of restic chunks to gdrive |

Data flow: `git commit → post-commit hook → restic snap → Garage:research-stack`; daily 03:00 timer → `rclone copy → gdrive:restic-mirror`.

Storage agent (`4-Infrastructure/storage/storage_agent.py`) runs an observe→decide→act loop every 15 minutes via systemd timer. All numeric thresholds are Q16_16. Receipts are JSONL hash-chained locally and uploaded to `s3://research-stack/agent-receipts/`.

---

## 12. ENE RDS Rust Workspace

`4-Infrastructure/infra/ene-rds/` is an 8-crate Rust workspace that replaces the Python RDS stack:

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `ene-rds-core` | Shared PostgreSQL client, DSN builder, receipts |
| `ene-rds-wiki` | Wiki CRUD + full-text search + revision tracking |
| `ene-rds-ephemeral` | EphemeralNode thermal zones, tasks, receipts, scars, metrics |
| `ene-rds-chat` | Chat session ingestion, keyword/semantic search |
| `ene-api` | Axum HTTP server on :3000 (health, sessions, wiki, ephemeral endpoints) |
| `ene-node` | Node identity and gossip primitives |
| `ene-storage` | S3/Garage object storage client |
| `ene-sync` | Polls opencode.db SQLite → upserts into RDS chat tables |

All crates use sqlx 0.8.6 (Dependabot vuln from 0.7 resolved 2026-05-19).

---

## 13. Braid Eigensolid Compressor

The braid eigensolid compressor is the planned compute substrate for the 8-strand BraidStorm topology:

- **Eigensolid:** converged stable state of a braid crossing loop; detected when `crossStep(s) = s`
- **Sidon labels:** addresses from a set where all pairwise sums are unique (powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128)
- **Sidon slack:** `address budget − max label used` encodes capacity headroom
- **Crossing matrix C:** Q0_2 crossing weights per strand pair; contractiveness enforced (row sum < 65536)
- **Receipt dimensions:** `(C, σ, k, ε_seq, t, ∅_scars)` — the receipt IS the compressed state

WGSL dispatch plan: `4-Infrastructure/shim/braid_blitter/` (Rust wgpu, following `5-Applications/parquet_compressor/src/gpu.rs`).

Two required Lean theorems per compressor:
1. `eigensolid_convergence` — braid crossing loop stabilizes (**proven**, `EigensolidConvergence.lean`, commit `d84569a5`)
2. `receipt_invertible` — given the receipt, original state is reconstructible within bounded error (**pending**)
